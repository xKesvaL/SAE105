# Main page
-> Move projets hover animation over to projects/index.html
    -> Instead just have a slick simple design for 2/3 projects with [More...] that redirects onto projects/index.html
    -> In projets/index.html have 2 types of projects :
        -> Personnal projects in which i'll list some of my great achievings (none)
        -> School projects such as SAÃ‰s (french but means learning and evaluation situation) with critical learnings
            -> That's what school wants.
-> Remove contact from main page
    -> Instead just have it in it's own page (that can be accessed from footer or header)
