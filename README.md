# KesvaL's portfolio

Hi! My name is Jordan "KesvaL" as you may already have seen it from the website of the repo you're looking at!

Yes, that's my portfolio's repository and this is also where you can learn more from me. :)

## Website Code

I do not own every bit of the code you see in the repo, as some comes from other open-source websites. Beware of that fact if you'd ever wanna fork the repository.

### Sources

The icons you see on the website are from :

- iconsvg.xyz for every SVG icon
- iconinder.com for every PNG icon from projects
- github.com for the github PNG in the footer

Credits to the people for some of the code :

- Kevin Powell (Theme Switcher)

## Language

Yes. The code and the repo are in english but the website is in French, if you're ever a real english person, you'd have to either wait for the language changer implementation or just use the google translate extension.
